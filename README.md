# A Webscraper ft Selenium and Tor network
A Webscraper that uses Selenium and Tor to scrape the hardiest of websites!

This web scraper can be re-appropriated to scrape any website. It uses both selenium and Tor to scrape the most protected websites. Selenium mimics human behaviors when scraping and won't trip the website into thinking a bot is scraping it-- so it'll prevent a CAPTCHA from appearing. The Tor network allows you to tunnel your IP through the Tor network which prevents your IP from being banned. This is extremely useful if you need to scrape a large amount of data in a short time period. However, when scraping, always keep in mind that you can unncessarily load the site you're scraping from, so keep the sleep timer on and respect the website you're scraping!
